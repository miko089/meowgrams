# Meowgrams

I just wanted to create a nonograms in elm, project in this stage may look a little unfinished, but I've created states, models, parsing json in functional language and other strange things, and, in my opinion, now i know all, that I need. Also, project use an awful api, that causes many problems (some api's solutions don't match actual solutions and sometimes height mixed with width and blah-blah-blah). If you wanna test, get [this](https://nonogramapi-1-v4517841.deta.app/) api and find your ~~nono~~meowgram and find actual solution in field "goal". That's all, I think.
